## Why global application 
* Global applications can be deployed in multiple regions/ edge locations for decreases latency.
* Latency is time taken for a packet to reach a server, deploy applications closer to users to decrease latency and better experience
* Having a disaster recovery plan
1. if an entire AWS region goes down due to earthquake, storm, power, politics, etc, you can fail over to another region and the application would still be working 
2. This increases the availability of the application
* Distributed global infrastructure is harder to attack
* Key terms: 
1. Region: For deploying application and infrastructure
2. Availability zone: Made up of multiple data centers
3. Edge locations: for content delivery as close to users as possible
